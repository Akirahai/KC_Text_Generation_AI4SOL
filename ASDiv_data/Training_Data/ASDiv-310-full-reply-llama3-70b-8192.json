Understand the concept of fractions and equivalent ratios (4/5 of the distance).\n2. Apply multiplication to find the total distance (79 meters \u00d7 5 = 395 meters).\n3. Convert the total distance from meters to kilometers (395 meters \u00f7 1000 = 0.395 kilometers).\n\nBy applying these mathematical concepts, students can solve the problem and find the distance Martin was from the hole when he started, which is 0.395 kilometers.\n\nIn summary, the KC required to answer this question is 4.MD.A.2, which involves applying multiplication and division to solve problems involving fractions, decimals, and unit conversions."
